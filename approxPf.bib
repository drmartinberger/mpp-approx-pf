abstract = {The introduction of high-speed circuits to realize an arithmetic function f as a piecewise linear approximation has created a need to understand how the number of segments depends on the interval a?x?b and the desired approximation error ?. For the case of optimum non-uniform segments, we show that the number of segments is given as s(?)?c?, (??0+), where c=14?ab|f?(x)|dx. Experimental data shows that this approximation is close to the exact number of segments for a set of 14 benchmark functions. We also show that, if the segments have the same width (to reduce circuit complexity), then the number of segments is given by s(?)?c?, (??0+), where c=(b?a)|f?|max4.}
